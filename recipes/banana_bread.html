<h2>Description</h2>
    <p>If you're anything like me, then you probably hate spotty, overripe bananas.<br>
       You also probably feel pretty bad about having to throw them out when you<br>
       fail to eat them before they get all mushy. Thankfully, banana bread is pretty<br>
       easy to make and only requires basic baking ingredients that most people<br>
       probably already have sitting in the pantry. Go ahead and use up those spotty<br>
       bananas!</p>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 2/3 cups of all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp baking soda</li>
        <li>1/2 cup butter, unsalted</li>
        <li>1/2 cup sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp baking powder</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>1 tbsp neutral-flavored oil (eg, canola)</li>
        <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
        <li>4 bananas</li>
    </ul>

<h3>How to Make</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring butter and eggs to room temperature. Pre-heat the oven to 350 degress Farenheit (175 degrees Celcius).</li>
        <li>Put flour, salt, baking soda, and baking powder into a bowl and whisk together. Cream sugar and butter together in a separate bowl.</li>
        <li>Add eggs, oil, and vanilla to sugar mixture and beat until well-blended.</li>
        <li>Mash bananas with fork and add to egg mixture.</li>
        <li>Mix dry and wet ingredients together, then pour batter into a small loaf pan.</li>
        <li>Bake in the oven for about an hour. A toothpick poked into the middle should come out clean. Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
