<h2>Description</h2>
    <p>I've always preferred biscuits to English muffins, probably because of how buttery and flakey they are.<br>
       They can be eaten as a side with pretty much any meal and taste great with sausage gravy, jam, or even<br>
       just plain and fresh out of the oven!</p>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups self-rising flour</li>
        <li>1 tsp sugar</li>
        <li>1/4 cup butter, lard, or shortening</li>
        <li>2/3 cup milk or buttermilk</li>
    </ul>

<h3>How to Make</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Pre-heat the oven to 450 F (232 C). Whisk dry ingredients together in a bowl, then cut the butter in <br>
            with a pastry cutter. Dough should resemble crums about the size of peas.</li>
        <li>Gradually add milk and mix until dough is just wet.</li>
        <li>Gently roll dough into a ball and press down on lightly floured surface. Fold the dough in half, then<br>
            press again. Repeat this process three times, then roll out dough into about 1/2 thickness and cut biscuits.</li>
        <li>Arrange biscuits on a baking sheet and bake for about 10-14 minutes or until lightly browned.</li>
